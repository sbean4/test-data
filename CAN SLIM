C-Current Big or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per Share
The stocks you select should show a major percentage increase in current quarterly earnings per share 
(the most recently reported quarter) when compared to the prior year’s same quarter.
You should always compare a company’s earnings per share to the same quarter a year earlier, not to the prior quarter, 
to avoid any distortion resulting from seasonality. In other words, you don’t compare the December quarter’s 
earnings per share to the prior September quarter’s earnings per share. Rather, compare the December quarter to the 
December quarter of the previous year for a more accurate evaluation.
Many successful investors use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter.
Take particular note if the growth of both sales and earnings has accelerated for the last three quarters.
Current quarterly earnings per share should be up a major percentage—25% to 50% at a minimum—over the same quarter the previous year. 
The best companies can show earnings up 100% to 500% or more!

A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth
Select Stocks with 25% to 50% and Higher Annual Earnings Growth Rates
the greatest growth stocks of the past 50 years had ROEs of at least 17%. 
(The really superior growth situations will sport 25% to 50% ROEs.)
The EPS Rating measures a company’s two most recent quarters of earnings growth against the same quarters the year before and 
examines its growth rate over the last three years. The results are then compared with those of all other publicly traded 
companies and rated on a scale from 1 to 99, with 99 being best. An EPS Rating of 99 means a company has outperformed 99% of 
all other companies in terms of both annual and recent quarterly earnings performance.
Primary consideration should be given to whether the rate of change in earnings is substantially increasing or decreasing.
